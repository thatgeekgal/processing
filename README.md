## Processing

Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. It's built on Java.

Exploring its capabilities by building the sketch examples below.

## Sketch examples
* `sketch_bouncingball`: make a ball boucing off from edges (modular functions)
* `sketch_bubbles`: create different sizes of colorful bubbles and keep them flowing up (class and object arrays)
* `sketch_cutedog`: load a cute dog image into a pixel window (PImage class)
* `sketch_flowers`: load different flower images to create bubbles and make them flow up to top (PImage, class and object arrays)
* `sketch_frog`: load a frog image and manipulate its pixels (pixels)
* `sketch_mybuddy`: draw my buddy using basic proccessing functions (fill, ellipse, rect)
* `sketch_paint_with_pixels`: load a frog image and use its colors to fill circles (pixels)
* `sketch_particlecollison`: create particles and change colors if collision (class and object arrays)
* `sketch_pixels`: manipulate window's pixels to change colors (pixels)
